# Data-Science---Recommendation-System
# Book Recommender System

This repository contains a book recommender system built using cosine similarity scores. The system recommends books to users based on their reading preferences and the preferences of similar users. Here's an overview of the project:

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to recommend books to users based on their reading history. By calculating cosine similarity scores between users, the system identifies users with similar preferences and recommends books that those similar users have enjoyed.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (for calculating cosine similarity)

## Data

The dataset used for this project is available in the "book.csv" file. It contains information about users, book titles, and book ratings.

## Steps

1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Cleaning and transforming data
3. Building a user-book pivot table
4. Calculating cosine similarity scores between users
5. Identifying similar users and recommending books
6. Visualizing the distribution of book ratings

## Getting Started

You can run the book recommender system by cloning the repository and installing the required libraries. The main code for the system is available in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

You can install them using `pip install`.
